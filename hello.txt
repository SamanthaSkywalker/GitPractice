Hi, welcome to the Intro to Git workshop! Here are some practice tasks that we will complete in a few moments:
1. Create a new text file in this repository. Name it whatever you want, but make sure that it is distinct to you! You will import the other participant's files later on and we don't want any confusing file names.
2. Edit your file using whichever method you prefer. Introduce yourself by stating your name, major, and what time period you would visit if you had a time machine.
3. If you are using a text editor, save your file and exit the editor. 
4. Stage the file
5. Commit the file, and don't forget to include a descriptive commit message!
6. Push the file to the remote repository's master branch
7. If you want, you can refresh this github page in your browser, you should see your new file included in the list of files!
